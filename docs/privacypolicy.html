			<h1>Grades Privacy Policy</h1>
			<h2>Data You Provide Us</h2>
			<p id="policy">Your account login information is securely stored on your local device in the encrypted keychain and potentially in any iCloud backups you may have. If you make a school or district suggestion, we will store the contact email you provide us only for the purposes of contacting you about your suggestion. We do not sell or give any of your information to any 3rd parties nor do we ever plan to.</p>

			<h2>Data Collected Via Technology</h2>
			<p id="policy"><strong>Analytics</strong> We use analytics services to analyze how our users use the app. These services may track how long users use the app, what pages inside the app users visit, errors users encounter, and the school and district the user is from. All this data is completely anonymous. No names or personally identifying information is stored or collected. This data is only used to improve the app.</p> 

			<h2>Use of your Data</h2>
			<p id="policy">Grades uses your Aeries account login information to access your classes and grades. This information is only sent to your district's Aeries server. We do not make use of your class and grade data other than to display to you. As of October 31, 2017, there is one exception to this rule. Grades launched an experimental Class Chat feature to a few users which sends Grades your Aeries class list. We use this data to add you to group chats and then this data is promptly deleted.</p> 

			<h2>Student Online Personal Information Protection Act Compliance</h2>
			<p id="policy">We comply with SOPIPA. As such, we do not engage in targeted advertising using student data given to us, we do not use the information given to us to create a profile about students, we do not sell information given to us, and we do not share any information given to us.</p>

			<h2>Your Consent</h2>
